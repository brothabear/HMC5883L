A library for I<sup>2</sup>C interaction with HMC5883L 3-axis digital magnetometers. More
information about the HMC5883L can be found in the [datasheet provided by Honeywell](http://www51.honeywell.com/aero/common/documents/myaerospacecatalog-documents/Defense_Brochures-documents/HMC5883L_3-Axis_Digital_Compass_IC.pdf).

The `I2CDevice` library provides an interface between the `HMC5883L` class and Arduino
microcontrollers, and can be replaced by any equivalent interface to support other interfaces.

Full documentation for this library can be found [here](https://pganssle.github.io/HMC5883L/documentation/).
